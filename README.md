# gscp
A script to ease adding and pushing code with git

The process of adding and pushing files with git may tend to be boring and repetitive.
Do less with one script, check git status, add files to staging area, commit the staged files with a message, and push with **"gscp"** script.

#### How to use the script
### Step 1. Download the script from the github repo.
[Link To Repo](https://github.com/kyagie/gscp.git)
`git clone https://github.com/kyagie/gscp.git`
### Step 2. Paste the script in the a folder called bin in your user directory.
If you do not have this folder, create it in the /home/{user} directory, with `mkdir bin`. And paste the script here.

You should end up with something like this `/home/arthur/bin/gscp`

### Step 3. Change permissions on the file.
`chmod 755 gscp`

**The script is now ready for use globally**
